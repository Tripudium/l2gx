"""
Overlapping Stochastic Block Model (OSBM)

The OSBM extends the classical Stochastic Block Model to allow nodes to belong to
multiple communities. Edge probabilities depend on the communities that nodes belong to.

Key features:
1. Nodes can belong to multiple overlapping communities
2. Edge probability between nodes depends on their shared community memberships
3. Flexible mixing parameters control intra vs inter-community connectivity
4. Supports various community assignment schemes

This model is excellent for patch-based testing because:
- Overlapping communities create natural patch boundaries
- Edge probabilities create realistic community structure
- Controllable overlap allows testing different patch overlap scenarios
